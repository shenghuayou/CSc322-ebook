We have 3 parts in our system: GUI, application and database. There are 3 type of users: Super足User, Registered足User and Visitor. We grant different authority to these 3 type of users. Super足User is able to monitor registered users, approve or reject Registered Users credit requests. In addition the Super User can approve or reject pending documents and handle reports from the Registered Users. Registered足User is able to upload document with a credit request, rent a document, report a document containing offensive material. The Registered User can also view and open documents from the table and filter documents with words the Registered User selects. The Visitor is able to preview the document table. We have many functions in Software like upload a document, open a document and report a document users communicate with Database by using some functions in Software.
